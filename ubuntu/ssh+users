assumption:
keypair was already added for root user on remote server.
goal:
create another user on remote server and make sudo possible
copy ssh keypair to homedir of this new user
set permissions
then
disable rootlogin AND enable login only with authorized_keys
++++++



$ ssh root@ipaddress
root@servername:~# adduser dev
root@servername:~# gpasswd -a dev sudo

++++++
+Copy SSH Keys to Dev User
+Since we added our SSH keys
+to the root users's authorized_keys during Droplet creation, 
+let's copy those keys over to our new dev user:

root@servername:~# mkdir /home/dev/.ssh
root@servername:~# cp .ssh/authorized_keys /home/dev/.ssh/
root@servername:~# chown -R dev:dev /home/dev/.ssh/

++++++
+disable pw logins AND key only login
root@servername:~# nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
...
PermitRootLogin no
...
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
...
PasswordAuthentication no
...
UsePAM no
...


++++++
+restart ssh service
root@servername:~# service ssh restart



++++++ try this someday!
add servername of remote to your ssh config:
localmachine: ~ yourname$nano ~/.ssh/config

Host servername
  Hostname ipaddress
  User dev
